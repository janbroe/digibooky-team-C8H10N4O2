# Digibooky

![Digibooky logo](digibooky.png)

Digibooky is going to revolutionize the classic libraries. Users will come to the VR offices where VR headsets are available. 
Using these VR headsets, users can roam Digibooky's digital library, where they can make their preferred selection of books to borrow.

The front-end of Digibooky will run on the VR enabled computer. 
It'll be developed in a later stage by a company specialized in VR applications.

The front-end of Digibooky will communicate with the back-end of Digibooky through a REST(ful) Web API over HTTP(S), 
using JSON as its message format. This back-end will contain the entire domain and all the business logic.
It's your job to implement this back-end.

## Technical requirements for JAVA

- Create a new GitHub repository (one per team)
- Provide a REST(ful) Web API (with JSON as the message / body format)
- Use Spring Boot (latest release)
- Use Maven
- Set up a Jenkins or Travis for continuous integration
    - We'll help you with this...
- Perform logging (use spring-boot-starter's logging dependencies: logback and slf4j)
    - Certainly log all interactions with the application that can be defined as "errors"
        - E.g., unauthorized access, illegal arguments, exceptions in general,...
- Include OpenAPI using Swagger(UI) to provide a readable documentation/manual of your REST(ful) Web API
- Use Lists or HashMaps to store your data (fake in-memory database).
    - Store them in a specific class / classes (e.g. `AuthorTable` or `DigibookyDatabase`)
    - (You could also try to store it in files, but that's not recommended)
- (This only applies when ORM/JPA has been taught): use JPA (Hibernate / EclipseLink) in combination with PostgreSQL or Oracle to store and access the data in a persistent way
    - Correctly set up and handle the transactions.

## Technical requirements for .NET

- Create a new GitHub repository (one per team)
- Provide a REST(ful) Web API (with JSON as the message / body format)
- Use ASP.NET Core Web API
- Use AzureDevops for continuous integration
    - We'll help you with this
- Perform logging (use logging provided by .NET Core)
    - Certainly log all interactions with the application that can be defined as "errors"
        - E.g., unauthorized access, illegal arguments, exceptions in general,...
- Include OpenAPI using Swagger(UI) to provide a readable documentation/manual of your REST(ful) Web API
- Use Lists or HashMaps to store your data (fake in-memory database).
    - Store them in a specific class / classes (e.g. `AuthorTable` or `DigibookyDatabase`)
    - (You can also try to store it in files, but that's not recommended)
- (This only applies when ORM has been taught): Use Entity Framework instead of in-memory Lists,...  

## Architectural Setup

Provide a multi-module setup where each module (not package) represents a 'layer'.
- Although a layered architecture might not be the best architecture (for big projects), when used properly(!), it is actually 
a nice way of separating concerns in your code. Read the following links:
    - http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2016/04/25/layers_hexagons_features_and_components.html
    - http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2015/03/08/package_by_component_and_architecturally_aligned_testing.html
- We're proposing 5 layers: war (top-level), api, service, domain and infrastructure (lowest-level)
    - But, at the very least provide an api, service and domain module.
    - The war module can be used to package together the whole application (also contains the Main Class)
    - The infrastructure can be used to contain code on which all other modules can depend.
    
Furthermore, use DTOs for encapsulating the payload of a request or response consumed or produced by your Web API. 
(and ideally a different DTO for both the request and response of a call to your Web API)

## Functional Stories

The functional requirements are written down as stories. 

- The functional analyst will be available to answer all your questions (they'll speak for the customer Digibooky)
- The functional analyst made some design decisions, if you want to challenge those, you always can. Come prepared though. :grin:

only the first name, only the last name or both.
- Prioritization: Must-Have

### Story 6A: Register as user
As a user I want to be able to register myself as a new Digibooky user, so I can perform additional actions. 
This user should have a unique INSS (social security number), last name, first name, email, street name, street number, postal code and city. 
- A user should contain a unique user identification number (create/choose your own, don't use INSS)

- One Admin user should exist on startup.
- If any other user tries to view all user within the system, the server should respond with 403 Forbidden and a custom message.

### Story 17: Overdue Fines
As a Librarian I want to create a fine when a user returns a book that is overdue, so I can penalize this behavior.
- The maximum loan period is 3 weeks
- The formula to calculate the fine is: `€5 + €2 * FULL_WEEKS_OVERDUE`
    - E.g.

- Try to suggest some additional data to your customer that could be useful for inclusion in the report.
- Prioritization: Nice-To-Have

## DigibookyFin (Nice-To-Have)
DigibookyFin is a stand-alone application that runs on a different port and has its own GitHub repository.
It handles the financial administration of Digibooky, i.e. it allows for the generation and sending of invoices.

This is an optional application, make sure Digibooky is working properly before starting with DigibookyFin.

### Story 1: 
As an accountant I want to generate an invoice for a certain user so that I can add this invoice as an attachment to an email.
- The unique user identification number should be provided to identify the user
- The invoice should contain the complete information about the user (full name + address) and all its unpaid fines.
    - This user and fine information should be requested (Digibooky contains this information)
    - DigibookyFin should not store any user or fine information (besides their unique identification numbers)
- The first invoice of a user always contains the subscription fee of €15.

### Story 2:
As an accountant I want to get an overview of the invoices generated for a user.
- The overview should show the unique invoice number, the full name of the user and the total amount of the invoice for each invoice.

### Story 3:
As an accountant I want to mark an invoice as paid, so I can keep track of which invoices are paid.

## Possible expansions
1. Digibooky can offer e-books, DVDs or any other media.
2. A review system that will be linked with your facebook page.
